# kiper
A small wrapper of kingpin + viper. I like the way viper handles the config files however I am a fan of kinping because it can validate the command line flags easily. This library is just a combination of the features of this two projects.

# Feature

* Merge command line flags and config file settings.
* Validate command line flags and config file bothly.
